		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<div id="aboutme2">
			<p>I am currently a Sophomore at <a href="https://www.gemsworldacademy-chicago.com/">GEMS World Academy</a> and this is my current website. This will mostly focus on academia projects, but my other interests are but not limited to: playing volleyball during the summer and photography, if I am feeling very creative. I also enjoy baking and cooking for family and friends gatherings. I am a very open-minded, loving, and responsible person. My goals in life are to gradute high school with my DP diploma. After that, I would like to go to University of Michigan college to study for master in general dentistry. When I gradute college I would like to work somewhere in the medical field but, if it does not work in that certain direction, I would like to start my own business.</p>
